Ophelia
=======

Ophelia is a web based mongo query viewer.  The war file can be deployed into any standard servlet container.  When run
on a machine, you can connect to the local mongo instance and run queries over any collection you'd like.  Currently,
it only works for local instances of mongo but that will change soon.  Hopefully.

How to run it
======

Simply download the war file and deploy in to your favorite servlet container.

Ophelia requires Java 7 and is built using [angularjs](http://www.angularjs.org) and [jersey](http://jersey.java.net)
There are several interesting bits I have in mind but I'm ready for feedback.  If you find any bugs or have feature
requests, please [file](https://github.com/evanchooly/ophelia/issues) an issue.
